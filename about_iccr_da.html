        established under the University of Delhi in 1962, is a pioneer Institution in the field of Distance 
        Education in India. The country witnessed the beginning of an alternate mode of education when the 
        School started with a modest admission of 900 students in 1962. The School enrolled more than two 
        lakhs students in the Academic Session 2006-2007. On many occasions our students have been toppers 
        in various disciplines. The admission process for various courses in the School is governed by the
         norms established by the University of Delhi. The examination is also conducted by the University
          of Delhi. The University of Delhi confers the degree to the students of the School as it does in 
          the case of its other constituent colleges. There is no differentiation in the course curriculum 
          followed by the School of Open Learning and other constituent colleges and Departments of the 
          University of Delhi. In an effort to reach out to a larger number of students the school is in
           the process of opening up Study Center in the Eastern and the Western part of the National 
           Capital Region of Delhi. The School offers Undergraduate/ Postgraduate Degree courses in the 
           subjects of Arts/Humanities and Commerce. The medium of instruction is primarily through well
           - prepared printed course material which is distributed by mail to all the enrolled students.
            This is also supplemented through Personal Contact Program conducted for the benefit of students
             at various study centers run by the School. An experienced faculty is always available at the 
             main campus for academic interaction with students. The School offers learning through the
              distance education mode which is a viable alternative for students who need a flexible medium
               of instruction to attain higher education and vocational skills. .</p>
